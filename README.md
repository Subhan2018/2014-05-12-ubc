Software Carpentry Bootcamps
============================

This repo originated as a clone of this repo: [https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc). The `README` landing page contains instructions for serving up a bootcamp website.

Remember the website comes from the `gh-pages` branch.

The rendered website is here: [https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc)

7.  Edit `index.html` to create the bootcamp home page (see below).
    Please double-check the information in the page's header (described below),
    as it is used to update the main website.

10. Push content to your YYYY-MM-DD-site repository:

    ~~~
    git push origin gh-pages
    ~~~
